                          dumping fastq files from sra
                          ============================

before you perform the extraction, you should make a quick estimation about the 
hard-drive space required. the final fastq-files will be approximately 7 times 
the size of the accession. the fasterq-dump-tool needs temporary space 
( scratch space ) of about 1.5 times the amount of the final fastq-files during 
the conversion. overall, the space you need during the conversion is 
approximately 17 times the size of the accession. you can check how much space 
you have by running the `df -h .` command. under the 4th column ( avail ), you 
see the amount of space you have available. please take into consideration that 
there might be quotas set by your administrator which are not always visible. 
if the limit is exceeded, the 'fasterq-dump'-tool will fail and a message will 
be displayed.

the simplest way to run fasterq-dump is:

    $ fasterq-dump srr000001

this assumes that you have previously 'prefetched' the accession into the 
current working directory. if the directory srr000001 is not there, the tool 
will try to access the accession over the network. this will be much slower and 
might eventually fail due to network timeouts.

notice that you use the accession as a command line argument. the tool will use 
the current directory as scratch-space and will also put the output-files there. 
when finished, the tool will delete all temporary files it created. you will now 
have 3 files in your working directory:

    srr000001.fastq    srr000001_1.fastq    srr000001_2.fastq

if you want to have the output files created in a different directory, 
use the --outdir option.

the fasterq-dump-tool performs a split-3 operation by default. the 
fasterq-dump-tool is not identical to the former fastq-dump-tool with regards to 
command line options. the following is a comparison between fastq-dump and 
fasterq-dump:

split-3

    $ fastq-dump srr000001 --split-3 --skip-technical
    $ fasterq-dump srr000001

split-spot

    $ fastq-dump srr000001 --split-spot --skip-technical
    $ fasterq-dump srr000001 --split-spot

split-files

    $ fastq-dump srr000001 --split-files --skip-technical
    $ fasterq-dump srr000001 --split-files

concatenated

    $ fastq-dump srr000001
    $ fasterq-dump srr000001 --concatenate-reads --include-technical

important differences to fastq-dump include the following:

-   the -z|--stdout option does not work for split-3 and split-files. the tool 
    will fall back to producing files in these cases.

-   there is no --gzip|--bizp2 option. you have to compress your files 
    explicitly after they have been written.

-   there is no -a option for the accession, only the ability to specify the
    accession or a path directly. the tool will extract the output-name from 
    the given accession or path.

-   the fasterq-dump-tool does not take multiple accessions, just one.

-   there is no -n|--minspotid and no -x|--maxspotid option. the tool always 
    processes the entire accession.

or else, we can just use the previous fastq dump:

    fastq-dump --split-files --gzip srr000001
