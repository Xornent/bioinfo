                                ===================
                          (downloading from sra archives)

the combination of prefetch + fasterq-dump is the fastest way to extract 
fastq-files from sra-accessions. the prefetch tool downloads all necessary files 
to your computer. the `prefetch` - tool can be invoked multiple times if the 
download did not succeed. it will not start from the beginning every time; 
instead, it will pick up from where the last invocation failed.

after the download, you have the option to test the downloaded data with the 
`vdb-validate` tool. after the successful download, there is no need for 
network connectivity. you can move the folder created by prefetch to a different 
location to perform the conversion to the fastq-format somewhere else (for 
instance to a compute-cluster without internet access).

there are a couple of points here:

-   the prefetch-tool downloads to a directory named by accession. e.g. 
    `prefetch srr000001` will create a directory named `srr000001` in the 
    current directory. make sure that if you move the `srr000001` directory, 
    you don't rename it as the conversion-tool will need to find the original 
    directory.

-   if you don't have internet access - run `vdb-config -i` and make sure that 
    enable remote access is not checked.


into what location will the prefetch save the downloaded files?
==============================================================

this will depend on the configuration of the toolkit. there are 3 options:

-   in the current working directory
-   in the user-repository
-   user-defined location

you can choose between options 1 and 2 with the vdb-config - tool:

    $ vdb-config --prefetch-to-cwd
    $ vdb-config --prefetch-to-user-repo
    $ prefetch srr000001 -o /path/to/be/used 

make sure the last directory of /path/to/be/used is the accession itself. 
e.g. prefetch srr000001 -o /path/to/be/used/srr000001 the sra tools expect that 
all files of the run srr000001 are stored in a directory having the same name as 
the accession: srr000001. it is called "accession as directory".


check the maximum-size limit
============================

the prefetch-tool has a default maximum download-size of 20g. if the requested 
accession is bigger than 20g, you will need to increase that limit. you can 
specify an extremely high limit no matter how large the requested accession is. 
you can also query the accession-size using the `vdb-dump-tool` and the `--info`
option. for instance, 

    vdb-dump srr000001 --info 

tells you how large this accession is (among other information). the accession 
srr000001 has 932,308,473 bytes, which is below the default limit, so no further 
action is necessary. the accession srr1951777 has 410,112,373,995 bytes. to 
download this accession you have to lift the limit above that size:

    $ prefetch srr1951777 --max-size 420000000000

you can specify the limit in:

    --max-size 10 == --max-size 10k : 10 kilobytes,
    megabytes: --max-size 10m : 10 megabytes,
    gigabytes: --max-size 10g : 10 gigabytes,
    terabytes: --max-size 10t : 10 terabytes,
    unlimited: --max-size u.
