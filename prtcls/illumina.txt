                        illumina sequencing libraries
                        =============================

the nature of illumina sequencing is still sequencing by synthesis (sbs). any 
sbs method requires the presence of adaptors, which are short double-stranded 
dna oligos whose sequences are known to us. the adaptors are designed by 
scientists, and there are a few popular adaptor sequences that are used in the 
ngs field. the following three (actually two main types to be honest) are the 
most popular ones:

there are some other adaptors that can be used, but they either become obsolete 
or not used usually. if you are interested, you can check the illumina adapter 
sequences document for full details. basically, the nature of an illumina library 
preparation is the process of adding those coloured adaptor seuqences to both 
sides of the dna of your interest, which is the "-insert-" bit in the above 
examples. all the commercial kits you buy for the library preparation do exactly 
that, no matter where your buy them, no matter what you want to sequence. in 
addition, you can also mix different types of adaptors due to the reaons mentioned 
in the "library sequencing" section below. for example, you can use truseq read 
1 at the left hand side, and nextera read 2 at the right hand side. or you can 
use nextera read 1 at the left hand side and truseq read 2 at the right hand 
side. it is toally fine but not recommended for beginners. the "n"s in the above 
examples are the indices, or barcodes that discriminate different samples. the 
index at the right hand side is often called "i7", or index1, which is the index 
in the p7 primer; the index at the left hand side is called "i5", or index2, 
which is the index in the p5 primer. this is because the index "i7" is sequenced 
first before "i5" is sequenced. <check ./illumina-adaptors.pdf>

now, the mission is: how to add those adaptors? well, this is where you can 
become creative. in A PROFUSION OF CONFUSION IN NGS METHODS NAMING, 
<https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4558/> hadfield and retief mentioned over 
300 ngs methods in their enseqlopedia wiki. in this github repository, many 
single cell genomics methods are documented. all of them do and only do one 
thing: add those adaptors to the sides of the dna they want to sequence. then, 
what is the difference among all those methods? they differ from how they add 
those adaptors. <see https://enseqlopedia.com/enseqlopedia/>

another important detail is that we should know the only required seqeuences 
are the following two:

    Illumina P5 adaptor: 5'- AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC -3'

    Illumina P7 adaptor: 5'- CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT -3'

if you use illumina sequencing, you have to use and make sure they are at the 
sides of your dna fragments, like shown in the three examples above. the adaptor 
sequences in the middle like truseq read 1, truseq read 2, nextera read 1 and 
nextera read 2 can be changed. if you change them, you have to add your own 
sequencing primers to the machine during sequencing. a few single cell genomic 
methods listed in this github page used their own adaptors.


p5 and p7 adaptors
==================

the amplification of the illumina sequencing is called cluster generation (and
utilizing a patented technology called bridge pcr). here we present an overview
of the process (which may be introduced in any books concerning sec-gen sequencing):

the flow-cell is a glass media conctaining 8 channels. each chennel (lane) is a 
tiny groove on the flow cell. dna primers are pre-incubated and linked to the 
media: the p5' adaptor and the p7 adaptor. when given a target segment of dna
to amplify:

    [P5]-xxxxx-[P3]

(anneal 1)

               | [p7]
               x
               x
        [p5'] || [p5]     | [p5']    | [p7]
    -------------------------------------------------- lane

(extension 1)

        [p7'] || [p7]
              yx
              yx
        [p5'] || [p5]     | [p5']    | [p7]
    -------------------------------------------------- lane

(denaturation 1)

        [p7'] |
              y
              y
        [p5'] |           | [p5']    | [p7]
    -------------------------------------------------- lane

(anneal 2)

        [p7']  y
              y y
              y y
        [p5'] | || [p7]   | [p5']    | [p7]   
    -------------------------------------------------- lane

during the chain reaction, both the p5'-linked complementary chain [p5']-y-[p3']
and the template chain [p5]-x-[p3] got amplified.

    temp [free] -> comp --> temp --> comp --> temp
                     │        └-------------> comp
                     ├-------------> temp --> comp
                     └----------------------> temp

the result is that every single template chain (free-floating in the solution)
forms a cluster of nearly 1000k template-complementary cluster on the lane.
the final step including cutting all the [p5'] chains and wash them out (removing
the complementary chains) and leaving only the template duplications in the
cluster. and blocks all 5' ends to avoid excessive extension.


library sequencing
==================

once those adaptors are added propertly, we are ready to sequence them using 
illumina machines. in the sequencing reagents provided by illumina, the 
seuqencing primers are actually a mixture of different primers, including truseq, 
nextera and even those primers from kits that are obsolete. therefore, you 
actually can sequence different types of libraries together. for example, 
truseq librareis and nextera libraries can be mixed together and sequenced 
together without any problem. there are some slight differences among different 
illumina machines, in terms of how they sequence read 1, read 2, index 1 and 
index 2. check <./illumina-indexed-seq.pdf> for more details.


(step 1) add read 1 sequencing primer mixture to sequence the first read 
         (bottom strand as template):

notes:

- since there can both have read 1 and 2, they are all pair-ended sequencing.
  reading the insert from two directions.

- sequencing on illumina-based platforms typically gives you two reads R1 and R2,
  as well as one or two indices. in the raw data (those given by a sequencing
  machine, but not the downloadable sample-specific data) the indices are present,
  and is used to assign which two strands are a pair, as well as assigning
  dna sequences to samples. as this is finished (we can see on the web data
  archive sequences that already belongs to a certain sample), the website only
  gives you the true reads (R1 and R2) in fastq format.
