        Human Lung Cell Atlas: Although single cell RNA sequencing studies have 
        begun providing compendia of cell expression profiles, it has proven 
        more difficult to systematically identify and localize all molecular 
        cell types in individual organs to create a full molecular cell atlas. 
        From droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA sequencing applied to 
        ~75,000 human lung and blood cells, combined with a multi-pronged cell 
        annotation approach that includes extensive tissue localization, we have 
        defined the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell 
        populations in the human lung, including 41 of 45 previously known cell 
        types or subtypes and 14 new ones.

        Sequencing reads are available on the European Genome-phenome Archive.
